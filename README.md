# Two-Stage-Operational-Amplifier
# Designed and simulated a two-stage CMOS operational amplifier using LTSpice in 180nm process technology
# Optimized the amplifier’s performance parameters such as gain, bandwidth, and stability through various methods.
# Conducted DC and AC simulations to validate the amplifier’s functionality and performance under varying operating
conditions
