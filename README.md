# Differential-Amplifier-Using-CMOS-Technology
 Designed and simulated a differential amplifier with active load using LTSpice in 180nm process technology.
 Optimized the amplifier’s performance parameters such as gain, bandwidth, and stability through various methods.
 Conducted DC and AC simulations to validate the amplifier’s functionality and performance under varying operating conditions.
